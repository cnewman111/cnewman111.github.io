    </div>
    <div class="section-text">
        <p> The first thing we need to do is create a set of correspondences between me and my friend's faces.  This is because the computer has to have some notion of how the two
            images relate to each other so that it can do morphing properly.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The most simple way of doing this is simply by creating a tool where you click on one face, then the other.  One example is I would click my chin, then my friend's chin.

            This is useful for defining specific places on the image that are equivalent, but what we really need is a way to map ANY pixel in one image to one or more pixels in the other image.
            In order to do this, we need to extend this notion of equivalence to regions that have a combined area that covers the entire image.
        </p>

        <p>
            We do this by using something called a triangulation, which can be defined as a set of edges between the verticies we defined, such that no two lines overlap.  
            This will seperate the image into regions such that every point is in exactly one region. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We could do this by hand, but a better way is to use the Delanay Triangulation, which is more optimal in the sense that it maxmizes the smallest angles possible in 
            the triangulation.  This is good, because that means there will be fewer long, skinny triangles, which we will see later is suboptimal for morphing.  This algorithm is 
            O(nlog(n)) over all verticies.
        </p>

        <p> It is important to note that because the algorithm gives the edges between verticies, it matters whether we use my point set or my friends.  In order to give reasonable behavior
            to both images, we calculate which edges should be connected based on the average of the two point sets.  The result of triangulating using those edges is shown on my friend and I below.

        <h2> Part 2: Computing the "Mid-Way Face" </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-text">
        <p> Now that we have a method for defining equivalent regions in each image, we need a way of actually computing the transformation.  Because we are working with
            straight lines, a good starting guess would be to work with a linear system of equations.
        </p>
        <p> If it were the case that every triangle had its bottom left point centered at the origin, we would be able to just do a simple linear transformation to map
            any point on my face or my friend's face to any other triangle.  Unfortunately, we cannot make this assumption  - triangles can be translated, in addition to being
            scaled.  This means we have to do an aphine transformation of the form y = Ax + b to map one triangle in the source image to the target shape, where x is the original coordinate
            and y is the resulting coordinate.
        </p>
        <p> Fortunately, it is possible to take these 3 equations (one for each point on the triangle) and stack them into one larger equation of the form y = Ax, where A is a 6 x 6 matrix.  
            Assuming the triangulation was valid, this matrix has a nonzero determinant, and we can simply solve for the mapping.
            </p>

        <p> Finally, by calculating the transformation for every triangle that maps every point in the triangle to the average triangulation of me and Connor, we produce the following images: </p>

            a sequence of images, to use in a gif or video.  This formula is used for a weighted average of both the triangulation and the pixel values.
